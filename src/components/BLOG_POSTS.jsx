        blog: 'The 2025 Chevrolet Corvette is capable of 0-60 miles per hour in just  2.3 seconds and blasting through the quarter mile in 9.6 seconds with a  trap speed of 150 mph. That’s Bugatti Chiron, Porsche 918 Spyder, and McLaren P1 levels of blisteringly quick. The mind-boggling numbers are pulled off if the 2025 Corvette ZR1 is  equipped with the ZTK package, which includes the Carbon Fiber Aero  package seen in the pictures, along with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R  tires.'

        description: "The trench coats of today are way more versatile than they might appear, and will go well in plenty of everyday situations, from ultra-casual to formal. Here are some ways to style a trench coat, complementing whatever direction the rest of the outfit goes in. ",

        blog: "For a dressier evening out, the trench coat rules are actually much the same as for work. Whether over a blazer with relaxed pants or jeans, or a dress, keep the trench coat medium length, fitted but not too fitted, and in a neutral color that’s either contrasting or exactly matching the color of what’s underneath. Bonus points if they are all in the same color family. One of the easiest rules for looking immediately polished is, after all, following a monochromatic palette. As always, a pair of heels helps transition the look into nighttime territory.Here’s one caveat, though: For ultra-formal events (black tie or white tie), a trench coat is generally not recommended. While trench coats work well with many formal suiting looks, they are not quite formal enough for your most glam moments. For those, choose a dark-colored wool or cashmere overcoat with clean lines, or for women, more formal evening or cropped jackets (depending on season or weather) meant to be worn over an evening gown."

        blog: "Work can play a huge role in your overall health and welfare. In addition to the financial benefits, your job can add meaning, structure, and purpose to your life. It can also provide you with a sense of identity, bolster your self-esteem, and offer an important social outlet.However, working in a negative environment can have the opposite effect and take a heavy toll on your emotional health. Long hours, understaffing, a lack of support, and harassment in the workplace can ramp up your stress levels and contribute to mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. These problems have only been exacerbated by the pandemic and the major shifts in our working habits over the last couple of years. Many of us have spent months adapting to the new stressors of working remotely, for example, only to now have to re-adjust to commuting and working onsite again. It’s left us feeling tense, unhappy, and worried about the future and how we spend our days.Just as work can impact your mental health, so too, your mental health can affect your work, impacting your job performance and productivity. In fact, recent estimates suggest mental health issues cost the global economy $1 trillion annually in lost productivity, absenteeism, and staff turnover."

Ventura Nationals is like a huge family and friends get-together that happens to be into hotrods and custom cars.",

        blog: "The participants quickly  filled up the Ventura Fair Grounds with their fantastic rides. As the gates opened for the show, an incredible live band was rocking the stage. Wenzdaze was first up playing, I'd say, punk music, but with their unique sound, they are a young band. On the way up to Ventura, I listened to Dave Grohl's The storyteller. Dave was the drummer for Nirvana, and this band fit right into Dave's story when he was starting out.Right after Wenzdaze, SoCal's The Hula Girls played their brand of beach rockabilly music; they were very entertaining. You would be lucky to get one live band at a car show, but at Ventura Nationals, one or two live bands were not enough. After The Hula Girls' band finished playing, Lil' Mo & The Dynaflows rocked the stage with their smooth 50's Doo Wop music. But, not even three bands were enough for Ventura Nationals this year.Stopmin' Riffrafs from Japan took the stage playing their unique 50's early 60's version of rockabilly. Stompin' Rifftrafs started playing on the Tokyo underground music scene in 2006; Stompin' Riffrafts call themselves a man and three chicks. They were a blast to watch, and they were having just as much fun playing their music as the we were watching them."
